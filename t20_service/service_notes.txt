# System service uses

- interacting with cloud, hardware, local or on-pc resources
- shouldn't be closed accidentally

# Suitability

Program must:
- not have a GUI (must be text-based input/output if any)
- not need any input from the system console (keyboard, mouse, display)
- be able to run non-interactives
- run continuously (i.e. not finish)

# How this works
